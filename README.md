Vagrant Virtualbox setup for Docker EE 17.06 on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04
========================

This vagrant file is provided strictly for demonstration purposes to help setup a cluster environment that installs HAProxy for loadbalancing, Docker EE, UCP, and DTR. This can be used as a demo environment on your local machine, when internet access is not present.

After running `vagrant up`:
- UCP will be accessible from `https:\\ucp.local`
- DTR will be accessible from `https:\\dtr.local`

This template will also setup the VMs with static ip addresses as follows (if IP addresses are already in use, change them inside of the Vagrantfile):
- `haproxy` (HAProxy LB): 172.28.128.30
- `ucp-node1` (UCP manager node): 172.28.128.31
- `ucp-node2` (UCP manager node2, not provisioned - optional): 172.28.128.32
- `ucp-node3` (UCP manager node3, not provisioned - optional): 172.28.128.33
- `dtr-node1` (DTR replica): 172.28.128.34
- `worker-node1` (Worker node): 172.28.128.35
- `worker-node2` (Worker node): 172.28.128.36

DNS entries for landrush:
- `dtr.local`: 172.28.128.30
- `ucp.local`: 172.28.128.30
- `wordpress.local`: 172.28.128.31
- `jenkins.local`: 172.28.128.31
- `nodeapp.local`: 172.28.128.31
- `visualizer.local`: 172.28.128.31
